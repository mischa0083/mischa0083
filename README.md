**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!**

I'm mischa and I work remotely at GitHub in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Outside of work, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at WGU. 

I graduated from WWU with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems, and a minor in Japanese.
