**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!**

I'm mischa and I work remotely at GitHub in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Outside of work, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Western Governors University. 

I graduated from Western Washington University with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems and a minor in Japanese.
